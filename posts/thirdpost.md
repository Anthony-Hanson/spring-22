I am a student journalist and sports reporter from Decorah, Iowa in Northeast Iowa. I graduated from South Winneshiek High School in 2020. I then contined my education at my dream school. I am studying Journalism and Mass Communicaiton and General Business at Iowa State University. I will graduate in May of 2023.

At Iowa State, I've been very involved in student organizations. In August 2021, I joined the Iowa State Daily Sports Desk. I am a life-long fan of Iowa State sports so it was a dream to cover the Cyclone athletic department. Since August, I've evolved from a fan to a storyteller. I've covered Men's Golf, Swimming and Diving, and Softball for the Iowa State Daily. I've gained memories and valuable experiences as a long sports reporter and I can't wait to continue my career at the best student orgainzation on campus. 

In November 2021, I joined KURE 88.5 Ames Alternative to cover Men's and Women's Basketball for their website. I had a lot of fun covering the basketball season's in Ames.

In January 2022, I was hired by Saltech Systems in Ames as a Content Writing Intern. I've worked with a team of web designers and marketing department to write content for website homepages, blogs, and social media posts. I've gained valuable experiecne in this role and learned about marketing campaighns, search enginge optimizations, and countless other vaulable skills.
